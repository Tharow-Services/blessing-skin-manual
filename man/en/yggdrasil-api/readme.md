# Yggdrasil API

Please make sure you have read **all items** in this document before asking a question and that you really cannot solve this problem yourself.

Before asking a question, please add a `YGG_VERBOSE_LOG` entry in the .env file of the skin site and set the value to `true` to enable the "record verbose log" function (remember to turn it off after the problem is solved). After reproducing the problem, provide the available log file when asking the question (the log is located in `skin site root directory/storage/logs/yggdrasil.log`, which may contain sensitive information, please do not send it to people you don't trust) .
